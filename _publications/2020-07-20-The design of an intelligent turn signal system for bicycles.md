To address the safety risks posed by excessive cycling speed, sudden turns, or abrupt braking during daily rides, an intelligent bicycle turn signal system was designed based on grip sensing, posture correction, and bio-inspired design principles. This paper introduces the system's structure, analyzes its operational process, and designs the hardware and software of the control system. By sensing the grip force between the two handlebars, the system predicts the bicycle’s movements in advance and corrects them using a posture sensor, enabling precise control of the turn signals located at the ends of the handlebars to achieve the turn indication function.
