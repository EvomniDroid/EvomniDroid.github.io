## Education background
Hi! I am an research assistant at Department of Artificial Intelligence, Westlake University in Hangzhou under my advisor [Prof. Yaochu Jin](https://en.westlake.edu.cn/faculty/yaochu-jin.html). I obtained a double bachelor's degree in Mechatronics Engineering and Software Engineering from Northwest A&F University(985) in 2025. During this period, I conducted research internships at Tsinghua University starting in 2024, under my Horizontal project advisor [Prof. Fuchun Sun](https://www.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/info/1121/3555.htm) from the [National Key Laboratory of Intelligent Technology and Systems](https://www.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/info/1061/1023.htm) in the Department of Computer Science, and my vertical internship supervisors being [Postdoc. Weibin Gu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=PDP31hEAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Postdoc. Lu Shi](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=GhAmKBQAAAAJ) at [AIR](https://air.tsinghua.edu.cn/).

## Research experience
During my undergraduate studies, my research interests were in mobility and manipulation. During this time, I conducted extensive engineering practices and paper replications on perception, navigation, and manipulation, using platforms such as UAV, UGV, quadrupeds, humanoids, and robotic arms.

Currently, I define the science of my research field as understanding unknown semantics under an open vocabulary space in an open world to reach a specified location for performing specified operational tasks. I hope to achieve true physical intelligence based on this. If you have any ideas or projects that align with these interests, please feel free to contact me. I am always happy to collaborate and eager to learn from others in this vibrant community.
