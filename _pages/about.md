## Education background
Hi! I am an research assistant at Department of Artificial Intelligence, Westlake University in Hangzhou under my advisor [Prof. Yaochu Jin](https://en.westlake.edu.cn/faculty/yaochu-jin.html).I obtained a double bachelor's degree in Mechatronics Engineering and Software Engineering from Northwest A&F University (985) in 2025. During this period, I conducted research internships at Tsinghua University starting in 2024, under my Horizontal project advisor [Prof. Fuchun Sun](https://www.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/info/1121/3555.htm) from the National Key Laboratory of Intelligent Technology and Systems in the Department of Computer Science , and my vertical internship supervisors being [Postdoc. Weibin Gu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=PDP31hEAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Postdoc. Lu Shi](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=GhAmKBQAAAAJ) at [AIR](https://air.tsinghua.edu.cn/).

## Research experience
While at Zhejiang University, my research interests were flexible exoskeleton and locomotion tracking. These areas allowed me to combine my passion for computational methods with real-world rehabilitation challenges.

Currently, I find myself increasingly drawn to the exciting realm of humanoid robot. As the population ages, I aspire to contribute to the development of general-purpose humanoid robots in the field of elderly care. If you have ideas or projects that align with these interests, please do not hesitate to connect with me. I am always open to collaboration and eager to learn from others in this vibrant community.
